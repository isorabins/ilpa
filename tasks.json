Create new ILPA repository with proper .gitignore configuration\n3. Study F@4 code patterns (auth flow, memory system, LLM router, chat streaming)\n\n## Project Structure\n1. Set up project structure with backend and frontend folders\n2. Initialize package.json and requirements.txt files\n3. Configure proper folder hierarchy based on F@4 patterns\n\n## Platform and Tool Setup\n1. Create Vercel account and install CLI (for frontend deployment)\n2. Install Heroku CLI tools (for backend deployment)\n3. Set up new Supabase project for ILPA\n4. Obtain and securely store API keys (Anthropic, OpenAI)\n5. Create .env file with all necessary credentials\n\n## Database and Deployment\n1. Run initial Supabase migrations from F@4\n2. Test Heroku deployment for backend\n3. Test Vercel deployment for frontend and Supabase connection\n4. Create test_setup.py verification script to verify all components\n\n## Verification Steps\n1. Verify all CLI tools function properly\n2. Confirm API keys work with test requests\n3. Validate database connection and schema\n4. Test deployment pipeline end-to-end\n\n<info added on 2025-06-29T02:52:44.148Z>\n## Research Findings: F@4 Implementation Strategy for ILPA\n\n### Patterns to Copy Directly\n- LLM Router and Base Agent Patterns from F@4's main.py\n- Simple keyword search from simple_memory.py (not embeddings or complex search)\n- Frontend Project Structure including component organization and WebSocket updates\n\n### Patterns to Adapt\n- Database Models and ORM Integration (use F@4's schema.sql as reference)\n- Agent Role Definitions for multi-agent architecture\n- Frontend Authentication Flow for Supabase integration\n\n### Research-Guided Implementation Needs\n- Multi-Agent Coordination using message passing protocols\n- Long-Term Memory Summarization with provenance tracking\n- Advanced Frontend Features like drag-and-drop planning\n\n### File Path Mapping\n- src/database/client.py: Copy simple keyword search from F@4's simple_memory.py\n- src/models/: Adapt from F@4's schema.sql\n- src/agents/base_agent.py: Copy LLM router logic\n- src/agents/nightly_summarizer.py: Research-guided implementation\n- src/auth/middleware.py: Adapt F@4 auth patterns\n- src/frontend/: Copy/adapt F@4 structure\n\n### Implementation Priority\n1. Copy core LLM routing and simple keyword search patterns first\n2. Adapt authentication and basic agent roles next\n3. Research and implement multi-agent coordination last\n</info added on 2025-06-29T02:52:44.148Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-29T04:44:11.287Z>\n## Research Query: F@4 Implementation Patterns for ILPA\n\n### Key Implementation Files to Copy\n1. **LLM Router**: Copy `llm_router.py` from fridays-at-four repository directly\n2. **Memory System**: Extract keyword search functionality from `simple_memory.py`\n3. **Authentication Flow**: Copy `auth_middleware.py` and related JWT validation files\n4. **Frontend Components**: Reuse login, registration, and protected route components from FAF_website\n\n### Adaptation Strategy for Multi-Agent Architecture\n1. **Agent Communication Layer**:\n   - Create a new `agent_coordinator.py` file that handles message passing between agents\n   - Implement a standardized message format for inter-agent communication\n   - Add message queue system for asynchronous agent interactions\n\n2. **Database Schema Modifications**:\n   - Extend F@4's schema.sql to include agent-specific tables\n   - Add relationship tables for tracking agent interactions\n   - Create views for simplified data access patterns\n\n3. **Deployment Configuration**:\n   - Update Heroku Procfile to support multi-agent backend processes\n   - Configure Vercel environment variables for agent-specific frontend features\n   - Set up Supabase RLS policies for agent-specific data access\n\n### Implementation Priority Order\n1. Core infrastructure (auth, database, LLM router)\n2. Single-agent functionality testing\n3. Multi-agent communication layer\n4. Advanced features (planning tools, summarization)\n</info added on 2025-06-29T04:44:11.287Z>",
