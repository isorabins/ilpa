# Multi-Agent Life Planning System - PRD

## Executive Summary

**Project Name:** Integrated Life Planning Assistant (ILPA)
**Timeline:** 1 week for Phase 1 production-ready MVP
**Tech Stack:** **Heroku (FastAPI backend)** + **Vercel (React frontend)**, Supabase, Claude Agents with OpenAI fallback
**Development Approach:** Test-driven, leverage existing F@4 codebase patterns, clean and minimal

### The Core Concept: Interactive Life Coaching Through AI

This system fundamentally reimagines personal life planning by moving beyond static productivity tools to create an **interactive coaching experience** where specialized AI agents work together to provide integrated life guidance. The user has natural conversations with a Life Coach Agent throughout the week, then collaborates with a Weekly Planning Agent to create integrated plans using insights from domain-specific agents and uploaded artifacts.

**The Revolutionary Insight:** Most productivity and planning tools treat life areas as separate silos—health apps, business apps, creative apps, finance apps. This system recognizes that these areas actually support and influence each other when planned integratively. A person building a business while maintaining health goals and creative output needs planning that understands how these domains connect and reinforce each other.

***
IMPORTANT: we are using the Fridays at Four front and backend
for much of the code. Those are working repos, so whenever possible
use code from those projects rather than re-writing your own ***

### Phase 1 Architecture: Proven Patterns, Clear Separation

**Life Coach Agent:**
- Single point of contact for daily conversations
- Natural conversation interface about any life topic
- Persistent memory using F@4's proven conversation + memory table pattern
- SQL search tools to query domain tables when specifically asked
- Note: In Phase 1, Life Coach won't have access to domain data to keep it simple
- **Sample Prompt Direction:** "You are a supportive life coach who helps users reflect on their daily experiences, challenges, and growth. You remember past conversations and provide continuity..."

**Domain Agents (5 specialized):**
- Health Agent, Business Agent, Creative Agent, Travel Agent, Relationships Agent
- Process uploaded files and extract domain-specific insights
- Generate domain reports for Weekly Planning Agent
- Follow Claude agent best practices: simple, focused, stateless design
- Work entirely in background - users never interact with them directly

**Example File Types by Domain:**
- **Health:** Daily journal entries, workout logs, medical notes, mood tracking, sleep logs, nutrition diaries
- **Business:** Meeting notes, project updates, revenue reports, strategy docs, client feedback, goal tracking
- **Creative:** Writing drafts, project ideas, inspiration notes, progress logs, brainstorming sessions
- **Travel:** Trip planning docs, location research, travel journals, itineraries, experience reflections
- **Relationships:** Reflection notes, communication logs, social event planning, relationship insights

**Domain Agent Summary Format:**
Each domain agent delivers a structured weekly recommendation report:
```json
{
  "domain": "health",
  "week_of": "2024-01-15",
  "overview": "Based on your uploads, here's what I recommend focusing on this week...",
  "key_insights": [
    "You've been consistently exercising 4x/week",
    "Sleep quality improved when you meditated"
  ],
  "trends": [
    "Energy levels correlate with morning routine consistency",
    "Stress decreases with regular outdoor activities"
  ],
  "weekly_recommendations": [
    "Continue morning meditation practice",
    "Add one outdoor walk on low-energy days",
    "Track water intake to maintain hydration"
  ],
  "priority_level": "high" // high/medium/low based on user's current focus
}
```

**Weekly Planning Agent:**
- Interactive coaching conversation for weekly planning
- Reviews last week's plan completion status first
- Pulls insights from: Life Coach conversations/memory + all Domain Agent summaries
- Creates integrated weekly plans through collaborative dialogue
- Saves finalized plans to weekly_plans table
- 30-60 minute planning sessions (acceptable for personal use initially)
- **Context Assembly Order:**
  1. Previous week's plan and completion status
  2. Life Coach conversation summary (last 2 weeks)
  3. Domain agent recommendations (ordered by user's domain priorities)
- **Sample Prompt Direction:** "Guide the user through creating an integrated weekly plan. Start by reviewing last week's accomplishments and challenges, then incorporate recommendations from all life domains..."

**Memory Architecture (F@4 Pattern):**
- **conversations table**: All interactions stored permanently
- **memory table**: Short-term buffer with async background summarizations
- **Nightly summarizer**: Processes conversations → long-term memory (never summary of summary)
- **Memory table cleanup**: Deletes when hits 100 messages

**File Upload System:**
- User selects domain → routes to appropriate Domain Agent
- Domain Agents process files and store insights in domain tables
- Weekly Planning Agent accesses these insights during planning sessions

### Why This Approach Works

**For the User:**
- **Natural daily conversations** - just talk to Life Coach about anything
- **Intelligent domain organization** - Domain Agents automatically understand and categorize uploaded content
- **Integrated weekly planning** - Weekly Planning Agent sees full picture across all life areas
- **Collaborative plan creation** - user actively participates in creating plans they'll actually follow

**For the Architecture:**
- **Proven F@4 patterns** - conversation + memory system already battle-tested
- **Clean separation of concerns** - each agent has one clear responsibility
- **Phase 1 simplicity** - no complex domain extraction from conversations yet
- **Phase 2 ready** - architecture supports adding conversation → domain extraction later

## Technology Stack - CORRECTED

### Backend
- **Framework:** FastAPI (Python)
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL with async support)
- **Authentication:** Copy F@4's JWT patterns from main.py
- **AI Integration:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet/Haiku + OpenAI GPT-4 fallback
- **Memory System:** Copy F@4's simple_memory.py (keyword search only, NO embeddings)
- **Deployment:** **Heroku** (not Vercel)

### Frontend  
- **Framework:** Next.js 14 with React
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + Copy F@4's UI components
- **State Management:** React Context + Custom hooks
- **Authentication:** Copy FAF_website auth components directly
- **Deployment:** **Vercel**

### Infrastructure
- **File Storage:** Supabase Storage (text files only for MVP)
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL with simple tables, NO vector columns)
- **Memory Search:** Keyword-based with .ilike() queries only
- **Real-time:** Not needed for MVP
- **Monitoring:** Basic logging

### Critical Technical Corrections
- ❌ **Vercel for backend** → ✅ **Heroku for backend**
- ❌ **Embeddings/vector search** → ✅ **Simple keyword search with .ilike()**
- ❌ **"Supabase doesn't support async"** → ✅ **Supabase DOES support async**
- ❌ **Complex file parsing** → ✅ **Text files only (.txt, .md)**
- ❌ **Custom auth system** → ✅ **Copy F@4's auth directly**

## 🧪 **Setup Verification Script**

Create and run this BEFORE starting development:

```python
# test_setup.py - Run this BEFORE starting development
import os
from anthropic import Anthropic
import openai
from supabase import create_client
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

def test_apis():
    print("🧪 Testing API connections...\n")
    
    # Test Anthropic
    try:
        client = Anthropic(api_key=os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"))
        response = client.messages.create(
            model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Say 'API working'"}],
            max_tokens=10
        )
        print("✅ Anthropic API working")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ Anthropic API failed: {e}")
        print("   Fix: Check ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in .env")
    
    # Test OpenAI
    try:

        print("   Fix: Check SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY in .env")
    
    print("\n✨ All tests complete!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_apis()
```

## 📁 **Exact F@4 File Mapping**

Copy these files EXACTLY with NO modifications:

```bash
# EXACT F@4 FILES TO COPY (with their new locations)
F@4 File                                    → ILPA Location
fridays-at-four/src/llm_router.py         → src/llm/router.py
fridays-at-four/src/simple_memory.py      → src/memory/memory_manager.py
fridays-at-four/src/claude_client_simple.py → src/llm/claude_client.py
fridays-at-four/src/config.py             → src/config.py
fridays-at-four/src/main.py               → (copy auth patterns only to src/auth/middleware.py)

# Frontend files
FAF_website/auth/*                         → frontend/auth/*
FAF_website/hoc/withPrivateRoute.tsx      → frontend/hoc/withPrivateRoute.tsx
FAF_website/hoc/withPublicRoute.tsx       → frontend/hoc/withPublicRoute.tsx
FAF_website/components/ui/*                → frontend/components/ui/*
FAF_website/hooks/useAuth.tsx              → frontend/hooks/useAuth.tsx
```

## ⚠️ **Known Gotchas & Solutions**

### **Heroku Deployment Issues**
```bash
# Issue: "No web process running"
# Solution: Create Procfile with EXACT content:
echo 'web: uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT' > Procfile

# Issue: "Application error"
# Solution: Check logs
heroku logs --tail

# Issue: "Build failed"
# Solution: Ensure requirements.txt includes all dependencies
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### **Supabase Async Operations**
```python
# ❌ WRONG (common mistake)
result = supabase.table('users').select('*').execute()

# ✅ CORRECT (Supabase DOES support async)
result = await supabase.table('users').select('*').execute()
```

### **F@4 Memory System Confusion**
```python
# ❌ WRONG (looking for complex search)
from memory import semantic_search, create_embeddings

# ✅ CORRECT (F@4 uses simple keyword search ONLY)
results = await self.db.supabase.table('memories')\
    .select('*')\
    .eq('user_id', user_id)\
    .ilike('content', f'%{keyword}%')\
    .execute()
```

### **CORS Errors**
```python
# Add to src/main.py
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=[
        "https://your-app.vercel.app",  # Your Vercel domain
        "http://localhost:3000"          # Local development
    ],
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

### **File Upload Limits**
```python
# Heroku has 30s timeout - implement file size check
MAX_FILE_SIZE = 10 * 1024 * 1024  # 10MB

if file.size > MAX_FILE_SIZE:
    raise HTTPException(413, "File too large (max 10MB)")
```

## 🚀 **Deployment Commands (Copy-Paste Ready)**

### **Backend Deployment to Heroku**
```bash
# 1. Create Heroku app
cd ilpa-backend
heroku create ilpa-backend

# 2. Set environment variables
heroku config:set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
heroku config:set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
heroku config:set SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
heroku config:set SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
heroku config:set JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret

# 3. Create Procfile (EXACT content)
echo 'web: uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT' > Procfile

# 4. Create requirements.txt
pip freeze > requirements.txt

# 5. Deploy
git add .
git commit -m "Initial backend deployment"
git push heroku main

# 6. Verify deployment
heroku logs --tail
# Look for: "Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:xxxxx"
```

### **Frontend Deployment to Vercel**
```bash
# 1. Navigate to frontend
cd ilpa-frontend

# 2. Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod

# 3. Follow prompts and set these env vars in Vercel dashboard:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL = https://ilpa-backend.herokuapp.com
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL = your_supabase_url
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = your_supabase_anon_key
```

## ✅ **Deployment Verification Script**

Run this after deployment to verify everything works:

```python
# verify_deployment.py - Run after deployment
import requests
import json

def verify_deployment():
    print("🔍 Verifying deployment...\n")
    
    # Check backend health
    backend_url = "https://ilpa-backend.herokuapp.com/health"
    try:
        response = requests.get(backend_url, timeout=10)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            print("✅ Backend is healthy")
            print(f"   Response: {response.json()}")
        else:
            print(f"❌ Backend returned {response.status_code}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ Backend unreachable: {e}")
        print("   Fix: Check Heroku logs with 'heroku logs --tail'")
    
    # Check frontend
    frontend_url = "https://your-app.vercel.app"  # Replace with your URL
    try:
        response = requests.get(frontend_url, timeout=10)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            print("✅ Frontend is accessible")
        else:
            print(f"❌ Frontend returned {response.status_code}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ Frontend unreachable: {e}")
        print("   Fix: Check Vercel deployment dashboard")
    
    # Test backend API endpoint
    api_test_url = f"{backend_url.replace('/health', '')}/api/chat"
    try:
        # This should return 401 without auth, which is correct
        response = requests.post(api_test_url, json={"message": "test"})
        if response.status_code == 401:
            print("✅ API authentication is working (401 expected)")
        else:
            print(f"⚠️  API returned unexpected status: {response.status_code}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ API endpoint unreachable: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    verify_deployment()
```

## Developer Instructions & Philosophy

### Master Developer Approach
You are a senior full-stack developer who values:
- **Speed through simplicity** - Reuse F@4 patterns aggressively, don't reinvent wheels
- **Clean, readable code** - Every function should be obvious in purpose
- **Test-first mentality** - Write failing tests, then make them pass
- **Minimal viable features** - Build exactly what's needed for Phase 1, nothing more

### Test-Driven Development Protocol

**TDD Cycle for Every Feature:**
1. **Red:** Write a failing test that describes the behavior you want
2. **Green:** Write the minimal code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor:** Clean up code while keeping tests green
4. **Repeat:** Move to next smallest piece of functionality

**Testing Rules:**
- Every agent method gets a unit test before implementation
- Every API endpoint gets an integration test
- Every database operation includes user_id filtering validation
- Mock LLM responses for consistent testing
- Use real test database for integration tests
- Test LLM router fallback behavior

**Code Style Rules:**
- Functions do one thing well
- No function longer than 20 lines
- Clear variable names (`health_insights` not `hi`)
- Type hints on all functions
- **User ID filtering EVERYWHERE** - no data leakage between users
- Comments explain "why", not "what"

### Agent Architecture (Claude Best Practices)

**Base Agent Pattern:**
Follow Claude agent best practices - simple, focused, stateless design. Each agent should have a single clear responsibility. Use the F@4 LLM router pattern for all agents.

**Life Coach Agent (Daily Conversations):**
- Handles daily conversations with memory context
- Uses F@4's SimpleMemory pattern exactly
- Stores all conversations in both conversations and memory tables
- Does NOT access domain data in Phase 1 (simplicity)
- System prompt focuses on supportive, reflective conversation

**Domain Agents (File Processing Specialists):**
Each domain agent (Health, Business, Creative, Travel, Relationships):
- Processes uploaded files for their specific domain
- Extracts structured insights and stores as JSON
- Generates domain reports when requested by Weekly Planning Agent
- Works entirely in background - no user interaction
- Adds confidence scores to insights for future relevance scoring

**Weekly Planning Agent (Interactive Coaching):**
- Starts planning sessions with context from all sources
- Receives summaries from domain agents (not raw data)
- Receives Life Coach conversation summaries
- Facilitates interactive planning conversation
- Saves finalized plans to database
- Uses collaborative, coaching-oriented prompts

### API Layer (FastAPI on Vercel)

**Core Endpoints with User Security:**
Copy F@4's authentication pattern exactly. Every endpoint must validate user_id from JWT token.

**Required Endpoints:**
- `/api/chat` - Daily conversation with Life Coach
- `/api/upload` - File upload to specific domain
- `/api/planning/start` - Begin weekly planning session
- `/api/planning/{session_id}/message` - Continue planning conversation
- `/api/planning/{session_id}/finalize` - Save completed plan
- `/api/plans/{week_of}` - Retrieve weekly plan
- `/api/plans/{plan_id}/todos/{todo_index}` - Update todo completion

### Memory System (F@4 Pattern) - CORRECTED

**Copy F@4's memory system exactly:**
- SimpleMemory class for conversation persistence (NO embeddings)
- Simple keyword-based search with .ilike() queries only
- 100-message rolling window in memory table
- Never summarize summaries (prevent degradation)
- **Heroku Scheduler** for nightly processing (not Vercel cron)

### Frontend (React + F@4 Components)

**Reuse F@4 Components:**
- Chat interface for Life Coach conversations
- Streaming message display
- Authentication flow
- User profile management

**New Components (Keep Simple):**
- File upload with domain selection dropdown
- Weekly planning chat interface (reuse chat components)
- Basic plan display showing todos and priorities
- Simple navigation between Life Coach and Planning modes

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **User data isolation** → Use F@4's proven user_id filtering everywhere
2. **LLM router reliability** → Copy F@4's fallback system exactly
3. **Memory system complexity** → Use F@4 patterns without modification
4. **Agent coordination** → Keep agents simple and independent

### Contingency Plans
- **If domain agents struggle with file processing** → Store raw content, improve processing later
- **If weekly planning is too complex** → Simplify to basic report aggregation
- **If memory system has issues** → F@4's system is proven, debug integration
- **If deployment issues on Vercel** → F@4 deploys successfully, follow same pattern

### Phase 1 Scope Protection
- **Focus on core workflow**: daily chat → file uploads → weekly planning
- **Defer advanced features**: conversation domain extraction, webhooks, quick planning
- **Leverage proven patterns**: F@4 code works in production, reuse aggressively
- **Test with real use case**: personal daily use validates functionality

**Key Philosophy:** Build something that works perfectly for daily personal use before expanding functionality. Every feature must prove its value through actual usage, and the system should feel natural and helpful from day one. Reuse F@4 code wherever possible - it's already production-tested.
