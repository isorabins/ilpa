# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Health Domain Agent
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the specialized Health domain agent for processing health-related files (fitness trackers, medical records, nutrition logs) and extracting health insights using F@4 agent patterns.
# Details:
1. Create `src/agents/domain_agents/health_agent.py` file
2. Implement HealthAgent class that inherits from the base DomainAgent class
3. Define specialized methods for processing different health file types:
   - Fitness tracker data (CSV, JSON formats from popular devices)
   - Medical records (PDF parsing with focus on lab results, diagnoses)
   - Nutrition logs (caloric intake, macronutrients, meal timing)
4. Implement NLP techniques for health data extraction:
   - Named entity recognition for medical terms and conditions
   - Pattern matching for health metrics (blood pressure, heart rate, etc.)
   - Time series analysis for tracking health trends
5. Create specialized prompt templates for health insights generation
6. Implement confidence scoring for health insights based on data quality
7. Add methods for generating health reports and summaries
8. Implement data normalization for different health metrics
9. Create health-specific data storage schema in the database
10. Add privacy-focused processing with enhanced security for medical data
11. Implement integration with the Life Coach Agent for health recommendations
12. Add documentation for supported file formats and health metrics

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test HealthAgent class methods with mock health data
2. Test processing of sample fitness tracker files (Fitbit, Apple Health, Garmin)
3. Verify extraction of key health metrics from medical record PDFs
4. Test nutrition log parsing and macronutrient calculation
5. Validate confidence scoring with various quality levels of health data
6. Test health report generation with different combinations of data
7. Verify proper handling of time series health data
8. Test integration with Life Coach Agent for health recommendations
9. Validate privacy protections for sensitive medical information
10. Perform end-to-end testing with real-world health data samples
11. Test error handling for malformed or incomplete health files
