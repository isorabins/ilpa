# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement Creative Domain Agent
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the specialized Creative domain agent for processing creative files (writing samples, design work, creative project docs) and extracting creative insights using F@4 agent patterns.
# Details:
1. Create `src/agents/domain_agents/creative_agent.py`
2. Implement CreativeAgent class inheriting from the base DomainAgent class
3. Define specialized methods for processing different creative file types:
   - Text analysis for writing samples (tone, style, themes)
   - Image processing for design work (color schemes, layout patterns)
   - Document analysis for creative project docs (milestones, concepts)
4. Implement NLP techniques specific to creative content:
   - Sentiment analysis for emotional tone
   - Topic modeling to identify themes and concepts
   - Style classification for writing samples
5. Create specialized prompt templates for the LLM to extract creative insights
6. Implement confidence scoring system for creative insights
7. Design schema for storing creative insights in the database:
   - Creative themes
   - Style characteristics
   - Emotional patterns
   - Project concepts and milestones
8. Add methods for generating creative reports and summaries
9. Implement file type validation specific to creative domains (.doc, .pdf, .jpg, .png, etc.)
10. Create error handling for malformed or incompatible creative files

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test CreativeAgent class methods
2. Test processing of various creative file types:
   - Writing samples (short stories, essays, poetry)
   - Design files (mockups, sketches)
   - Project documentation (creative briefs, storyboards)
3. Verify correct extraction of creative insights from each file type
4. Validate confidence scoring mechanism with known sample files
5. Test storage and retrieval of creative insights from the database
6. Verify creative report generation with different insight combinations
7. Test error handling with malformed or incompatible files
8. Benchmark performance with large creative files
9. Validate integration with the file upload system
10. Test end-to-end workflow from file upload to insight extraction
