# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Life Coach Agent
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the Life Coach Agent with conversation and memory management.
# Details:
1. Create `src/agents/life_coach_agent.py`
2. Implement LifeCoachAgent class inheriting from BaseAgent
3. Copy F@4's SimpleMemory class for conversation persistence
4. Implement conversation storage in both conversations and memory tables
5. Create method for retrieving conversation history
6. Implement prompt template for life coach interactions
7. Add method for generating responses based on conversation history
8. Implement conversation session management

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test LifeCoachAgent methods
2. Test conversation persistence and retrieval
3. Verify memory management (100-message rolling window)
4. Test response generation with mock LLM calls
5. Validate conversation session handling

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Agent Class Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the core agent class, including its attributes, methods, and interfaces for extensibility and maintainability.
### Details:
Establish the base class for the agent, considering inheritance, encapsulation, and clear separation of concerns.

## 2. Implement Memory Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Develop mechanisms for the agent to store, update, and retrieve relevant information during and across sessions.
### Details:
Choose appropriate data structures and strategies (e.g., short-term vs. long-term memory) to ensure efficient and accurate memory handling.

## 3. Develop Conversation Storage Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create systems to persist and organize conversation history for each session.
### Details:
Design storage solutions (in-memory, database, or file-based) that support efficient retrieval and scalability.

## 4. Implement Retrieval Methods [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Build methods to access stored conversations and memory, supporting both contextual and historical queries.
### Details:
Ensure retrieval methods are optimized for speed and accuracy, and can handle edge cases such as incomplete or corrupted data.

## 5. Design Prompt Templating System [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Create a flexible system for constructing prompts dynamically based on conversation context and agent memory.
### Details:
Allow for reusable templates, variable interpolation, and context-aware prompt assembly.

## 6. Implement Response Generation Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.4, 5.5
### Description: Develop the logic for generating agent responses using prompt templates, memory, and conversation history.
### Details:
Integrate with language models or rule-based engines as needed, ensuring responses are coherent and contextually relevant.

## 7. Develop Session Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Build mechanisms to create, track, and terminate user sessions, linking them to conversation and memory storage.
### Details:
Ensure session lifecycle is robust, supports concurrent users, and handles session expiration or cleanup.

## 8. Integrate and Validate Agent Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.7
### Description: Combine all components, test end-to-end functionality, and validate maintainability and correctness.
### Details:
Perform integration testing, address edge cases, and refine interfaces for long-term maintainability.
