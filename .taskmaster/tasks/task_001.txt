# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Development Environment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the development environment including cloning F@4 repositories, configuring Vercel, Supabase, and API keys.
# Details:
1. Clone F@4 backend and frontend repositories
2. Study F@4 code patterns (auth flow, memory system, LLM router, chat streaming)
3. Create Vercel account and install CLI
4. Set up new Supabase project for ILPA
5. Obtain and securely store API keys (Anthropic, OpenAI)
6. Create .env file with all necessary credentials
7. Run initial Supabase migrations from F@4
8. Test Vercel deployment and Supabase connection
9. Create a simple script to verify Claude API functionality

## Research Findings: F@4 Implementation Strategy for ILPA

### Patterns to Copy Directly
- LLM Router and Base Agent Patterns from F@4's main.py
- Database Client User Filtering from simple_memory.py
- Frontend Project Structure including component organization and WebSocket updates

### Patterns to Adapt
- Database Models and ORM Integration (use F@4's schema.sql as reference)
- Agent Role Definitions for multi-agent architecture
- Frontend Authentication Flow for Supabase integration

### Research-Guided Implementation Needs
- Multi-Agent Coordination using message passing protocols
- Long-Term Memory Summarization with provenance tracking
- Advanced Frontend Features like drag-and-drop planning

### File Path Mapping
- src/database/client.py: Copy user filtering from F@4
- src/models/: Adapt from F@4's schema.sql
- src/agents/base_agent.py: Copy LLM router logic
- src/agents/nightly_summarizer.py: Research-guided implementation
- src/auth/middleware.py: Adapt F@4 auth patterns
- src/frontend/: Copy/adapt F@4 structure

### Implementation Priority
1. Copy core LLM routing and database patterns first
2. Adapt authentication and basic agent roles next
3. Research and implement multi-agent coordination last

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify successful cloning of F@4 repositories
2. Confirm Vercel CLI installation and login
3. Test Supabase connection using CLI
4. Validate API keys with test requests
5. Ensure successful Vercel deployment of a basic app
