# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Login/Registration Forms [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create frontend forms for user login and registration, including input validation and error handling.
### Details:
Ensure forms collect necessary user data (e.g., email, password) and provide feedback for invalid inputs.

## 2. Integrate JWT Generation and Storage [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Implement logic to handle JWT issuance upon successful login/registration and securely store the token on the client.
### Details:
Use secure storage mechanisms (e.g., HttpOnly cookies or localStorage) and ensure tokens are handled according to best practices.

## 3. Implement Protected Routes [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2
### Description: Set up frontend route guards or middleware to restrict access to authenticated users using JWT validation.
### Details:
Ensure protected routes check for valid JWTs and redirect unauthenticated users to the login page.

## 4. Develop Logout Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2
### Description: Allow users to log out by clearing JWTs and resetting authentication state.
### Details:
Ensure all authentication tokens are removed from storage and user is redirected appropriately.

## 5. Implement Password Reset Flow [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Create UI and backend integration for users to request password resets and set new passwords securely.
### Details:
Include email verification and secure token handling for password reset links.

## 6. Add 'Remember Me' Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2
### Description: Enable persistent login sessions by extending JWT expiration or using refresh tokens when 'Remember Me' is selected.
### Details:
Adjust token storage and expiration logic based on user preference.

## 7. Integrate Social Login Providers [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Allow users to authenticate using third-party providers (e.g., Google, Facebook) and handle token exchange.
### Details:
Implement OAuth flows and map social accounts to user profiles in the application.

## 8. Handle Session Timeout and Token Expiry [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2, 14.3
### Description: Detect expired JWTs and automatically log out users or prompt for re-authentication.
### Details:
Implement frontend checks for token validity and backend enforcement of token expiration.
