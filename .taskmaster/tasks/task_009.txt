# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Nightly Summarizer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the nightly summarizer for long-term memory processing.
# Details:
1. Create `src/agents/nightly_summarizer.py`
2. Implement NightlySummarizer class
3. Create method for processing conversations to long-term memory
4. Implement logic to avoid summarizing summaries
5. Add method for cleaning up memory table (delete after 100 messages)
6. Create Vercel cron job for nightly processing
7. Implement error handling and logging for nightly job
8. Add retry mechanism for failed summarizations

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test NightlySummarizer methods
2. Test conversation processing to long-term memory
3. Verify memory table cleanup
4. Test Vercel cron job execution
5. Validate error handling and retry mechanism

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Summarizer Class [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a class responsible for generating summaries from input text, supporting both single and batch processing.
### Details:
Define methods for initializing the summarizer, accepting input, and returning summaries. Ensure compatibility with the chosen LLM or summarization engine.

## 2. Implement Conversation Processing [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create logic to extract, preprocess, and structure conversation data for summarization.
### Details:
Handle parsing of conversation logs, cleaning irrelevant data, and formatting input for the summarizer class.

## 3. Develop Summary Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Integrate summarizer class with conversation processing to generate and store summaries.
### Details:
Implement workflow to pass processed conversations to the summarizer and manage summary outputs, including handling edge cases like empty or malformed input.

## 4. Implement Memory Cleanup [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Design and implement routines to clean up old or unnecessary data from memory and storage.
### Details:
Define criteria for data retention and deletion, ensuring efficient resource usage and compliance with data policies.

## 5. Set Up Cron Job for Scheduled Processing [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.4
### Description: Configure a cron job or equivalent scheduler to trigger conversation processing, summarization, and cleanup at defined intervals.
### Details:
Ensure the cron job reliably invokes the main processing pipeline and logs execution details.

## 6. Implement Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.5
### Description: Add robust error handling throughout the pipeline to catch, log, and respond to failures gracefully.
### Details:
Define exception handling strategies for each component, including fallback behaviors and user notifications if needed.

## 7. Integrate Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up comprehensive logging for all major actions, errors, and system events across the summarization workflow.
### Details:
Ensure logs capture sufficient context for debugging and monitoring, and are stored in a retrievable format.

## 8. Develop Retry Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a retry mechanism for failed summarization or processing tasks to improve reliability.
### Details:
Define retry policies (e.g., exponential backoff, max attempts) and integrate them with error handling and logging.
