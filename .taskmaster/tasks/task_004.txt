# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Authentication Middleware
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up authentication middleware using F@4 patterns.
# Details:
1. Create `src/auth/middleware.py`
2. Implement JWT validation using PyJWT
3. Create FastAPI dependency for user authentication
4. Integrate Supabase authentication
5. Implement user session management
6. Add rate limiting for authentication requests
7. Create user registration and login endpoints
8. Implement password hashing using bcrypt

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test JWT validation
2. Test authentication dependency with mock requests
3. Verify Supabase integration for auth
4. Test user registration and login flows
5. Validate rate limiting behavior

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Middleware File [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a middleware file to handle cross-cutting concerns such as request/response processing and integration with authentication mechanisms.
### Details:
This file will serve as the entry point for middleware logic, including hooks for authentication, logging, and error handling.

## 2. Implement JWT Validation Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop functions to validate JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and authorization.
### Details:
Use libraries such as python-jose to decode and verify JWTs, ensuring token integrity and validity for protected endpoints.

## 3. Set Up FastAPI Dependency Injection for Security [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Configure FastAPI dependencies to enforce authentication and authorization using JWT validation.
### Details:
Utilize FastAPI's dependency injection system to require JWT validation on protected routes, leveraging OAuth2PasswordBearer or custom dependencies.

## 4. Integrate Supabase for User Data Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Connect the application to Supabase for user registration, login, and session storage.
### Details:
Set up Supabase client, configure environment variables, and implement functions to interact with Supabase tables for user management.

## 5. Implement Session Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.4
### Description: Develop logic to manage user sessions, including storing and retrieving session data securely.
### Details:
Use FastAPI session middleware or custom logic to handle session cookies or tokens, ensuring secure session lifecycle management.

## 6. Add Rate Limiting Middleware [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.5
### Description: Introduce middleware to limit the rate of incoming requests per user or IP address.
### Details:
Implement or integrate a rate limiting solution to prevent abuse of authentication endpoints and protect against brute-force attacks.

## 7. Develop Registration and Login Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create API endpoints for user registration and login, integrating JWT issuance and Supabase user management.
### Details:
Endpoints should handle input validation, password hashing, user creation, authentication, and JWT token generation.

## 8. Implement Secure Password Hashing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate password hashing using a secure algorithm such as bcrypt for storing user credentials.
### Details:
Utilize passlib with bcrypt to hash passwords during registration and verify hashes during login, ensuring password security.
