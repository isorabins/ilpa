# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement File Upload System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the file upload system with domain routing.
# Details:
1. Create `src/api/routers/uploads.py`
2. Implement file upload endpoint with FastAPI
3. Use python-multipart for handling file uploads
4. Implement domain selection logic
5. Create file processing queue using Redis
6. Implement background task for file processing
7. Update uploaded_files table with processing status
8. Implement file size and type validation
9. Add error handling for failed uploads or processing

# Test Strategy:
1. Test file upload endpoint with various file types
2. Verify correct domain routing
3. Test file processing queue functionality
4. Validate update of processing status
5. Test file size and type restrictions
6. Verify error handling for invalid uploads

# Subtasks:
## 1. Router Creation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the main router to handle incoming requests and route them to the appropriate endpoints.
### Details:
Define the base router structure, import necessary modules, and prepare for endpoint registration.

## 2. Endpoint Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Implement the specific endpoints for file upload and related operations.
### Details:
Create endpoints such as POST /upload and GET /status, ensuring they are registered with the router.

## 3. Multipart Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Integrate multipart/form-data parsing to support file uploads.
### Details:
Use a middleware or library to parse multipart requests and extract file data from incoming requests.

## 4. Domain Routing [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Configure routing logic to support domain-based or subdomain-based routing if required.
### Details:
Set up logic to route requests based on domain or subdomain, enabling multi-tenant or domain-specific handling.

## 5. Queue Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Establish a queue system to manage background processing of uploaded files.
### Details:
Integrate a message queue or task queue (e.g., Bull, RabbitMQ) to handle async processing of uploads.

## 6. Background Processing [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.5
### Description: Implement background workers to process files asynchronously after upload.
### Details:
Create worker processes that consume tasks from the queue and perform file processing (e.g., virus scan, resizing).

## 7. Status Updates [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enable status tracking and reporting for file uploads and background tasks.
### Details:
Store and expose status information (e.g., pending, processing, complete, failed) via API endpoints.

## 8. Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Implement validation for incoming requests and uploaded files.
### Details:
Validate file types, sizes, and any additional metadata using schema validators or custom logic.

## 9. Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3, 8.5, 8.8
### Description: Add robust error handling throughout the upload and processing pipeline.
### Details:
Catch and respond to errors at each stage, providing meaningful error messages and status codes.
