# Task ID: 20
# Title: Implement Travel Domain Agent
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the specialized Travel domain agent for processing travel-related files (itineraries, photos, travel journals) and extracting travel insights using F@4 agent patterns.
# Details:
1. Create `src/agents/domain_agents/travel_agent.py` file
2. Implement TravelAgent class inheriting from the base DomainAgent class
3. Define travel-specific file processing methods for different file types:
   - Itinerary processing (PDF, text) to extract destinations, dates, accommodations
   - Photo analysis (JPEG, PNG) to extract location data from EXIF and identify landmarks
   - Travel journal processing (text, markdown) to extract sentiment, locations, activities
4. Implement NLP techniques for travel domain:
   - Named entity recognition for locations, attractions, and accommodations
   - Temporal extraction for travel dates and durations
   - Sentiment analysis for experience evaluation
5. Create specialized prompt templates for the LLM to extract travel insights
6. Implement confidence scoring for extracted travel insights
7. Design schema for storing travel-specific data in the database:
   - Destinations table (location, dates, purpose)
   - Activities table (activity type, location, sentiment)
   - Accommodations table (name, location, dates, notes)
8. Add methods for generating travel reports and recommendations
9. Implement error handling for various file formats and processing failures
10. Add logging for tracking processing steps and debugging

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test TravelAgent class methods with mock data
2. Test itinerary processing with sample PDFs and text files containing travel plans
3. Verify photo analysis with sample images containing EXIF location data
4. Test travel journal processing with sample text entries
5. Validate named entity recognition for travel-specific entities
6. Test temporal extraction for travel dates and durations
7. Verify sentiment analysis for travel experiences
8. Test database storage of extracted travel insights
9. Validate confidence scoring mechanism for travel data
10. Test travel report generation with sample processed data
11. Verify error handling with malformed or incomplete travel files
12. Perform integration testing with the file upload system
