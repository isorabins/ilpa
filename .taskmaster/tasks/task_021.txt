# Task ID: 21
# Title: Implement Relationships Domain Agent
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the specialized Relationships domain agent for processing relationship files (communication logs, social media exports, relationship journals) and extracting relationship insights using F@4 agent patterns.
# Details:
1. Create `src/agents/domain_agents/relationships_agent.py` file
2. Implement RelationshipsAgent class inheriting from the base DomainAgent class
3. Define specialized methods for processing relationship-specific file types:
   - Communication logs (text messages, call logs, emails)
   - Social media exports (friend connections, interaction history)
   - Relationship journals (text entries about relationships)
4. Implement NLP techniques for relationship analysis:
   - Entity recognition for identifying people and relationships
   - Sentiment analysis to detect emotional patterns in communications
   - Topic modeling to identify recurring themes in relationships
   - Temporal analysis to track relationship changes over time
5. Create specialized prompt templates for the LLM to extract relationship insights
6. Implement methods to categorize relationships (family, friends, romantic, professional)
7. Add functionality to identify relationship strengths, challenges, and patterns
8. Create methods to generate relationship summaries and recommendations
9. Implement confidence scoring for relationship insights
10. Add proper error handling for malformed or incomplete relationship data
11. Ensure all extracted insights are stored in the relationships domain table
12. Implement methods to retrieve and format relationship insights for the Life Coach Agent

# Test Strategy:
1. Create unit tests for the RelationshipsAgent class and all its methods
2. Test processing of various relationship file formats:
   - Sample text message exports (iOS, Android formats)
   - Email thread exports (Gmail, Outlook formats)
   - Social media data exports (Facebook, LinkedIn formats)
   - Journal entries in different formats (text, markdown, PDF)
3. Verify correct entity extraction with test files containing known relationships
4. Validate sentiment analysis accuracy with pre-labeled relationship communications
5. Test relationship categorization with diverse relationship examples
6. Verify temporal analysis with communications spanning different time periods
7. Test confidence scoring with ambiguous relationship data
8. Validate storage of relationship insights in the database
9. Test integration with the Life Coach Agent for utilizing relationship insights
10. Verify error handling with malformed or corrupted relationship files
11. Benchmark processing performance with large relationship datasets
