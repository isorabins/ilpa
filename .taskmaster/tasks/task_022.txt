# Task ID: 22
# Title: Implement Core API Endpoints
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Create essential API endpoints for chat, authentication, and health checks using F@4 FastAPI patterns with streaming support and proper error handling.
# Details:
1. Create `src/api/routers/` directory structure for organizing endpoints
2. Implement `/api/chat` endpoints:
   - POST `/api/chat/message` for sending messages with streaming support
   - GET `/api/chat/history` for retrieving conversation history
   - DELETE `/api/chat/conversation/{id}` for deleting conversations
3. Implement `/api/auth` endpoints:
   - POST `/api/auth/register` for user registration
   - POST `/api/auth/login` for user authentication
   - POST `/api/auth/refresh` for token refresh
   - POST `/api/auth/logout` for user logout
4. Implement health check endpoint at `/api/health` for monitoring
5. Add proper request validation using Pydantic models for all endpoints
6. Implement streaming response handling for chat endpoints using FastAPI's StreamingResponse
7. Create comprehensive error handling middleware:
   - Implement custom exception classes for different error types
   - Create exception handlers for returning appropriate HTTP status codes
   - Add detailed error messages in development mode
8. Implement rate limiting for all endpoints to prevent abuse
9. Add proper logging for all API requests and responses
10. Ensure all endpoints are properly authenticated using the authentication middleware
11. Implement proper CORS configuration for frontend integration

# Test Strategy:
1. Write unit tests for each endpoint using pytest and FastAPI's TestClient
2. Test chat endpoints with both normal and streaming responses
3. Verify authentication endpoints with valid and invalid credentials
4. Test health check endpoint returns appropriate status
5. Validate request validation by sending malformed requests
6. Test error handling by triggering various error conditions
7. Verify rate limiting by sending multiple requests in quick succession
8. Test CORS configuration with requests from different origins
9. Perform load testing to ensure endpoints can handle expected traffic
10. Create integration tests that verify the complete request/response cycle
11. Test streaming functionality with various client connection scenarios (slow connections, disconnects)
