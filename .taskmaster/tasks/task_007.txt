# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Weekly Planning Agent
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the Weekly Planning Agent for interactive planning sessions.
# Details:
1. Create `src/agents/weekly_planning_agent.py`
2. Implement WeeklyPlanningAgent class inheriting from BaseAgent
3. Create methods for starting, continuing, and finalizing planning sessions
4. Implement logic to aggregate domain reports and life coach summaries
5. Create prompt template for interactive planning
6. Implement plan storage in weekly_plans table
7. Add method for retrieving previous week's plan and completion status
8. Implement collaborative dialogue management for plan creation

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test WeeklyPlanningAgent methods
2. Test planning session workflow (start, continue, finalize)
3. Verify correct aggregation of domain reports and summaries
4. Test plan storage and retrieval
5. Validate interactive planning dialogue

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Agent Class Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the core agent class, including attributes and methods for handling planning, dialogue, and data aggregation.
### Details:
Specify class interfaces, inheritance, and modularity to support future extensions and integration with other components.

## 2. Implement Planning Session Methods [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop methods for initiating, updating, and finalizing planning sessions within the agent.
### Details:
Ensure session methods can manage state, handle user input, and coordinate with other agent functions.

## 3. Develop Domain Report Aggregation Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create mechanisms to aggregate and synthesize data from multiple domain sources for reporting.
### Details:
Implement data fetching, normalization, and aggregation routines to support comprehensive domain reports.

## 4. Create Prompt Templates [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Design and implement prompt templates for agent interactions, ensuring clarity and context preservation.
### Details:
Use best practices in prompt engineering, including markdown formatting, stepwise instructions, and fallback phrases.

## 5. Implement Plan Storage Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Develop a system for storing and retrieving planning session data and generated plans.
### Details:
Choose appropriate storage solutions (e.g., database, in-memory) and ensure data integrity and accessibility.

## 6. Develop Plan Retrieval Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.5
### Description: Enable efficient retrieval of stored plans and session data for ongoing or future interactions.
### Details:
Implement search, filtering, and versioning features to support complex retrieval scenarios.

## 7. Implement Dialogue Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.4
### Description: Build a dialogue management layer to handle multi-turn conversations, context tracking, and error handling.
### Details:
Ensure the system can manage user context, preserve session continuity, and gracefully handle ambiguities.

## 8. Develop Unit Tests for All Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.7
### Description: Write comprehensive unit tests for agent class, planning methods, aggregation logic, prompt templates, storage, retrieval, and dialogue management.
### Details:
Ensure high test coverage, including edge cases and error handling, to maintain code quality and reliability.
