# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement API Endpoints
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 7, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Create core API endpoints for the application.
# Details:
1. Create `src/api/routers/` for core endpoint categories
2. Implement health check endpoints
3. Create basic CRUD endpoints for essential resources
4. Add user authentication to all endpoints
5. Implement request validation using Pydantic models
6. Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
7. Implement error handling and appropriate HTTP status codes

# Test Strategy:
1. Test each API endpoint with valid and invalid requests
2. Verify authentication on all endpoints
3. Test rate limiting behavior
4. Validate request and response schemas
5. Test error handling for various scenarios

# Subtasks:
## 1. Router Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the main API router to coordinate all core endpoints and route traffic appropriately.
### Details:
Establish a modular router structure that supports versioned endpoints and dynamic route management. Ensure routes are easy to extend and maintain.

## 2. Health Check Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Implement health check endpoints to monitor API status and availability.
### Details:
Create endpoints that verify database connectivity, service health, and overall API status. Include detailed diagnostics for internal health checks.

## 3. Basic CRUD Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Implement essential Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for core resources.
### Details:
Develop standardized RESTful endpoints for managing core application resources. Ensure consistent patterns across all CRUD operations.

## 4. Authentication Middleware [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Develop and integrate authentication mechanisms to secure all endpoints.
### Details:
Implement JWT or OAuth2 authentication, ensuring only authorized users can access protected resources.

## 5. Validation Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Implement input validation for all endpoints to ensure data integrity and prevent malformed requests.
### Details:
Use schema validation libraries to enforce request and response formats, returning clear error messages for invalid data.

## 6. Rate Limiting [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.5
### Description: Apply rate limiting to protect the API from abuse and ensure fair usage.
### Details:
Configure rate limiting middleware with configurable thresholds per user or IP, and provide informative responses when limits are exceeded.

## 7. Centralized Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Implement a centralized error handling mechanism to standardize error responses across the API.
### Details:
Ensure all errors are caught and returned in a consistent format, with appropriate HTTP status codes and messages.
