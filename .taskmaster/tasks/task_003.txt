# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Database Client and Models
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the database client with user filtering and create database models following F@4 patterns.
# Details:
1. Create `src/database/client.py` based on `fridays-at-four/src/simple_memory.py`
2. Implement DatabaseClient class using Supabase Python client
3. Add user filtering to all database operations following F@4 patterns from simple_memory.py
4. Create model definitions in `src/models/` directory
5. Reference `supabase/schema.sql` for database schema examples
6. Define SQLAlchemy models for all tables (conversations, memory, domain data, etc.)
7. Implement CRUD operations for each model with auto-dependency creation
8. Use asyncpg for asynchronous database operations
9. Implement connection pooling based on research-validated 2024 best practices

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test DatabaseClient methods
2. Verify user filtering on all operations
3. Test CRUD operations for each model
4. Validate data integrity and relationships
5. Performance test connection pooling
6. Ensure compatibility with F@4 patterns

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Async Database Client [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize and configure an asynchronous database client following patterns in fridays-at-four/src/simple_memory.py, ensuring async/await support.
### Details:
Create client in src/database/client.py based on F@4 patterns from simple_memory.py. Configure connection parameters using asyncpg and ensure the client supports async operations. Reference the research-validated 2024 best practices guide for implementation details.

## 2. Implement Connection Pooling [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Configure and tune connection pooling for the async database client based on research-validated 2024 best practices to handle concurrent access efficiently.
### Details:
Set pool size, timeout, and other relevant parameters following research-validated 2024 best practices for asyncpg connection pooling to avoid resource exhaustion and maximize throughput. Reference the research-validated guide for specific configuration values and implementation patterns.

## 3. Define Data Models [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create model definitions in src/models/ directory for all required entities following F@4 patterns and referencing supabase/schema.sql.
### Details:
Ensure models are compatible with async operations and include necessary fields, relationships, and constraints. Use supabase/schema.sql as reference for table structures and relationships. Follow model organization patterns from F@4's simple_memory.py implementation.

## 4. Implement CRUD Operations for Each Model [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Develop Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for each model using async methods with auto-dependency creation as in F@4.
### Details:
Use async/await for all database interactions and avoid blocking I/O. Implement auto-dependency creation following F@4 patterns from simple_memory.py. Ensure operations are robust and handle errors gracefully. Reference the research-validated 2024 best practices guide for implementation details.

## 5. Develop User Filtering Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.4
### Description: Implement filtering mechanisms for users based on F@4 patterns in simple_memory.py, leveraging async queries and ensuring proper access control.
### Details:
Support filtering by attributes such as username, email, or status. Follow exact patterns for user filtering from F@4's simple_memory.py to ensure consistent access control across the application. Ensure filters are efficient and non-blocking.

## 6. Integrate Async Support Across Application [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.4
### Description: Ensure all relevant parts of the application (routes, services, handlers) use async/await and do not mix synchronous code, following F@4 async patterns.
### Details:
Audit codebase for synchronous calls, refactor as needed, and enforce async best practices throughout. Reference fridays-at-four/src/simple_memory.py for async client patterns and implementation details. Apply research-validated 2024 best practices for asyncpg and async database operations.

## 7. Write Unit Tests for Each Model and CRUD Operation [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.4
### Description: Develop unit tests for all models and their CRUD operations, using async test frameworks where applicable, following F@4 testing patterns.
### Details:
Test all edge cases, error handling, and ensure tests run asynchronously to match production code. Reference F@4's simple_memory.py for testing patterns and best practices. Incorporate research-validated 2024 best practices for testing async database operations.

## 8. Test Connection Pooling and Async Performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.7
### Description: Simulate concurrent access to validate connection pooling configuration and async throughput under load, using research-validated 2024 performance testing approaches.
### Details:
Use load testing tools or custom scripts to ensure the system remains stable and performant with multiple simultaneous requests. Follow research-validated 2024 best practices for performance testing and benchmarking asyncpg connection pools.
